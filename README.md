# Description 

Ok, 2-3 months of study is behind me! Javascript, HTML and CSS in combo! 
Task list is simply for some people, not for me yet :D But I'm still practicing! Ok, but we should back to the project: 
HTML: only header, form and empty ul;

CSS: I think this project looks good. I was trying to copy my course mentor. Not pixel by pixel. I used: 
- BEM convention, trying at least;
- box sizing: border-box;
- nice font;
- display: flex;
- list styling; 
- media query;

JS: 
- many many functions, too many for me at the moment :D  
- arrays;
- obcjects; 
- event.preventDefault();
- addEventListeners;

I hope you enjoy!
